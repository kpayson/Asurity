# Scenario

We have a requirement to provide our customers an easy way to analyze rate spreads of their loan data records via an interactive user interface.  This interface should provide a pageable grid that lists only the record's respective rate spread fields. If a rate spread is greater than 1.5 the row in the grid should indicate that it's out of range. The user should be able to filter via certain rate spread fields.  Additionally, the grid should have a "View More" button to allow the user to see the complete view with the rest of the loan data fields for that record.  This view should be a separate page in the application.

In this sample project, we have provided a `loans.json` file containing the loan data records, as well as a description of the schema of that data below.  

## Rules

1. Create a Singe Page Application that implements the scenario above and:
    - Has one view for the grid
        - Grid should display these fields: `loanTerm`, `actionTakenType`, `lockInDate`, `amortizationType`, `apr`, `reverseMortgage`, and `rateSpread`
    - Has another view for the full loan record details
    - Any date or currency field should be displayed with proper formatting
2. Use any SPA framework of your choice.
3. Document your solution in a readme.md file in the root of the repository.
